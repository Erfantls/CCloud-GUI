# Linux Installation Guide for CCloud

## AppImage (Recommended)

The AppImage is the easiest way to run CCloud on Linux. It's a self-contained package that includes all necessary dependencies.

### Running the AppImage:

1. Download the AppImage file from the releases page
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x CCloud-*.AppImage
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./CCloud-*.AppImage
   ```

## Tar.gz Archive

The tar.gz archive contains the raw application files.

### Running from tar.gz:

1. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf CCloud-linux.tar.gz
   ```
2. Navigate to the bundle directory:
   ```bash
   cd bundle
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./AppRun
   ```

## DEB Package (Debian/Ubuntu)

Install using the package manager:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ccloud.deb
```

If there are dependency issues, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## RPM Package (Red Hat/Fedora)

Install using dnf (Fedora) or yum (older systems):

```bash
sudo dnf install ccloud.rpm
```

or

```bash
sudo yum install ccloud.rpm
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: g_once_init_enter_pointer"**
   This error occurs when there's a GLib version mismatch. The AppImage and packages should include all necessary libraries. If you still encounter this issue, try installing the required system libraries:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libglib2.0-0
   ```

2. **"execv error: No such file or directory"**
   Make sure the executable has proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ccloud_gui
   ```

3. **Missing dependencies**
   Install required system libraries:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0
   ```

### System Requirements:

- Linux kernel 4.4 or newer
- GLib 2.48 or newer
- GTK+ 3.20 or newer
